# Secrets

## Description
This write up will show how to solve the CTF for "Secrets"

## Solution
Opening the page and inspecting the code, there is a folder `secret`, used for images in the `assets` folder.</br>
Going to `/secret/` discoveres a new directory `hidden`.</br>
When going to `/secret/hidden/` it will show `superhidden/xdfgwd.html`.</br>
Going to `/secret/hidden/superhidden/` says that it should be there, but it is not on the page.</br>
Inspecting the source code, it shows the flag.
